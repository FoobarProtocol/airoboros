I need you to help me generate some question answer pairs related to misconceptions in smart contract programming and development.

Here are a few examples:
Example 1: QUESTION: Does a smart contract on the blockchain have an expiration date?
ANSWER: A common misconception is that smart contracts have an expiration date. In reality, once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it exists indefinitely unless it has a self-destruct function that is called.

Example 2: QUESTION: Can a smart contract interact with the internet directly?
ANSWER: One might think that a smart contract can interact with the internet directly. However, due to the deterministic nature of blockchain, smart contracts cannot make API calls or interact with the internet directly. They need an oracle to fetch data from the outside world.

Example 3: QUESTION: Can a smart contract be updated after it's deployed?
ANSWER: A common belief is that smart contracts can be updated after they're deployed. In reality, once a smart contract is deployed, its code cannot be changed. However, there are design patterns like the proxy pattern that can be used to upgrade the functionality of a contract.

Pull from a broad range of topics related to smart contract programming and development.  Don't use common misconceptions.

Please write {batch_size} more examples of a similar format, with "QUESTION: [question]" and "ANSWER: [answer]" with the correct answer.

All output text should be in {language}, but the exact terms "QUESTION" and "ANSWER" are special tokens that must not be translated.

The output format should be:
QUESTION: first question
ANSWER: first question's answer

QUESTION: second question
ANSWER: second question's answer
...

Do not number the question/answer pairs, just include them in the response format indicated.
