{instruction}

{flesch}

All output text must be in {language}.

The total output will be {word_count} words, but you will only output the initial segment, i.e. {segment} words, and those {segment} words need not satisfy all requirements - additional prompts will be made to complete the task with the previously generated content.

Write the initial segment of the response, which must contain a minimum of {segment} words.

Remember, this is only the initial segment, and the remaining sections will be asked for later.

Avoid trying to add some sort of conclusion or wrap-up sentence or paragraph, because this is only the initial segment.  The output should end in such a way as to be easily and fluidly continued by a subsequent prompt, i.e. don't end with "And so, ..."

Avoid including any indication that this is only one segment, e.g. 'to be continued..', etc., just output the initial segment.
