Below are several example questions/instructions.  I would like you to generate {batch_size} new similar examples, along with a context block, answer, and contextual answer.  All of the new examples must be nuanced questions about smart contract programming and development that cannot be answered without context.

The context block is a sentence or paragraph that provides a snippet of text that contains the answer to the question.  The answer block contains the answer, if answered without any context (i.e., your default answer if no information was provided).  The contextual answer contains the answer, based on the context block.

Example questions:
What is the current gas price in Ethereum?
What is the block time in Ethereum?
What's the next upgrade in Ethereum?
When is the next Bitcoin halving?
What project will Vitalik Buterin be working on next?
When was the Solidity language created?

Example output:
QUESTION: When is the next Ethereum upgrade?
CONTEXT: The current date is August 4, 2023. Ethereum developers have announced the "Serenity" upgrade to be launched in late 2023.
ANSWER: I don't have real-time information, however Ethereum upgrades are usually announced by the Ethereum developers and the exact dates can change based on various factors including testing, security audits, and consensus within the community.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's best to visit the official Ethereum website or follow their social media channels.
CONTEXTUALANSWER: The next Ethereum upgrade, "Serenity", is expected to be launched in late 2023.



All output must be in {language}, but the keys "QUESTION", "CONTEXT", "ANSWER", and "CONTEXTUALANSWER" are special keys that must not be translated.

Output format:
QUESTION: question 1
CONTEXT: context block providing an answer to question 1
ANSWER: default answer without information from context 1
CONTEXTUALANSWER: answer to question 1 provided context 1

QUESTION: question 2
...

Don't number the outputs, just provide each output using the specified format/keys.
