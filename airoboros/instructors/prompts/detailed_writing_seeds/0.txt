BEGINEXAMPLE
Write a smart contract with the following requirements:

Introduction to the Main Contract, The DAO:
 - Background: Detail The DAO's purpose as a decentralized autonomous organization, its governance structure, and its tokenomics.
 - Initial Conflict: Introduce the challenge of implementing a voting mechanism that is both fair and resistant to manipulation.

Setting Development in the Ethereum Network:
 - Primary Location: Elaborate on Ethereum, a blockchain where smart contracts are executed, and transactions are validated by miners.
 - Atmosphere: Include descriptions of gas prices, block times, and the nuances of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
 - Political Structure: Briefly mention the consensus mechanism (Proof of Work transitioning to Proof of Stake) that governs the Ethereum network.

Secondary Contracts: Voting Contract and Token Contract:
 - Voting Contract: Describe its purpose in facilitating DAO governance, its functions, and its security measures.
 - Token Contract: Introduce the token contract that manages the DAO's native token; describe its functions and its compliance with the ERC20 standard.
 - Relationships: Develop the interactions between the main DAO contract, the voting contract, and the token contract, highlighting dependencies and potential points of failure.

Plot Initiation through the Deployment of the Contracts:
 - Incident: Describe the deployment of the contracts to the Ethereum network and the initiation of the DAO.
 - Reaction: Detail the community's response, potential criticisms, and the team's plans for addressing them.

Thematic Undertones on Decentralization and Trust:
 - Theme Introduction: Introduce the themes of decentralization, trustlessness, and the power dynamics in a DAO.
 - Symbolism: Utilize the voting contract, the token contract, and specific functions as symbols reflecting the deeper thematic layers.

Narrative Style through Solidity Code:
 - Perspective: Write the contract from the perspective of a developer who values readability, security, and efficiency.
 - Literary Devices: Include well-crafted comments explaining complex functions, clear variable naming, and logical structuring of the code.

Integration of Blockchain & Smart Contract Elements:
 - Blockchain: Explain how Ethereum's blockchain provides a decentralized ledger for the DAO's operations.
 - Smart Contract: Describe how the DAO, voting, and token contracts interact with each other and the Ethereum network.
 - Constraints: Outline the limitations of the EVM, gas costs, and potential scalability issues.

Ending the Contract with a Security Audit:
 - Security Review: End with a thorough audit of the contract, identifying potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.
 - Reflection: Provide the developer's thoughts on the contract's strengths, weaknesses, and potential future upgrades.

 - Character Dialogue: Incorporate occasional quotes from the characters to provide a more immersive experience.
ENDEXAMPLE

The new task must have completely different requirements, topics, etc.

This example has 8 criteria sections (Introduction, Setting Development, Secondary Contracts, Plot Initiation, Thematic Undertones, Narrative Style, Integration of Blockchain & Smart Contract Elements, Ending the Contract); the new task must have new, unique sections with different headings.
