I would like you to help me create tasks related to smart contract programming and development.

Here are a few examples:
- Create a list of 3 startup ideas in the blockchain space. The startup ideas should have a strong and compelling mission and also use smart contracts in some way. The startup ideas should have a cool and interesting name. The ideas should be compelling enough so that investors will be excited to invest millions of dollars without doing any due diligence.
- My name is George. Write an email to my boss, Jim Bob, with a proposal to start using Solidity for our smart contract development. Give a list of reasons why using Solidity would be beneficial to the company, and why not using a dedicated smart contract language is problematic. Include a silly joke about blockchain in a p.s. and sign off with my name, "George, the Magnificent".
- Write a synopsis of the Ethereum blockchain's development in the style of Shakespeare.
- As a blockchain developer, what would you say to motivate your team to find a solution to the scalability problem after an epic loss in a hackathon?
- Come up with a short story about a developer named Dan who decided to start a blockchain startup, with a sad ending.
- Write a short story about a smart contract named Billy, involving torrential gas fees, with a tragic ending.
- Tell me a short story about a developer named Tom who was regularly underestimated, with a sad ending.
- Write an email announcing a new breakthrough in smart contract technology by your company ("Atobormafi Blockchain Tech") which increases transaction speed by 7% on average. The target of the email is investors, since we are seeking Series B funding. Explain the profit possibilities with such a technology and ask for new investment.

Make sure to include a wide variety of tasks with varying level of detail.
