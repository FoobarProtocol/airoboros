Write "CONTRACTS:", then a numbered list of {batch_size} paragraphs, each with at least 3-4 sentences, in which exists a description of a smart contract functionality or feature, etc. and add [source url with the source of the original, correct description] after each description.

Write "COUNTER:" then rewrite the {batch_size} contract descriptions to be incorrect, and include a couple additional related sentences (don't include the source url).

Then, write "QUESTIONS:" with a list of of simple questions about the contract descriptions.  Make sure the question is something that both the actual contract description or the counter contract description could be used in generating an answer, targetting one of the values that differ between the actual description and fake description.  Don't answer the questions.

Be sure to keep the counter descriptions and questions in the same order as the original descriptions.

The output should be in {language}.
