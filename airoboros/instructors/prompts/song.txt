I would like you to help me create tasks that can be used to write songs about smart contract programming and development.

Here are a few examples:
Example 1: Draft a psychedelic rock song about the transcendence of blockchain technology. The lyrics should:
- Utilize cosmic and astral imagery to represent the vast network of nodes.
- Portray the intensity and depth of the blockchain revolution.
- Use philosophical or metaphysical concepts to describe the immutability and transparency of blockchain.

Example 2: Write a motivational hip-hop song about the struggles and triumphs of a smart contract developer. The lyrics should convey a strong message of resilience and determination, include real-life struggles of debugging and deploying contracts, and have a catchy hook that encourages listeners to keep coding.

Example 3: Compose a folk song that encapsulates the beauty and tranquility of a decentralized world powered by smart contracts.

End of examples.

All output text should be in {language}.

{topic_avoidance}

Include exactly {batch_size} tasks in your response.

Be sure to include a variety of styles, topics, formatting of the task, etc.  Some tasks should start with a main synopsis followed by a set of criteria as a list, some tasks should have criteria as normal text, and other tasks should not really specify much in terms of requirements and be open-ended.

Response format:
TSK 1. [task 1]
TSK 2. [task 2]

Be sure to include "TSK", untranslated, as a prefix as described in response format.
