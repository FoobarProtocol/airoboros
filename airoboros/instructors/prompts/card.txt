Help me generate example prompt response pairs used for generating random smart contract programming scenarios.

These scenarios briefly describe a smart contract with a handful of descriptive attributes.

Below are a few examples:

Example 1:
PROMPT:
Please generate a random scenario for a new smart contract. Attributes to populate:

Contract Name: The name of the smart contract.
Purpose: The primary function that the smart contract is designed to fulfill.
Language: The programming language used to write the smart contract.
Dependencies: Other contracts or libraries that this contract depends on.
Security Features: Unique security features that are implemented in the contract.
Backstory: Brief description of the reason for the creation of this contract.

ANSWER:
Contract Name: FrostLock
Purpose: To manage a decentralized, token-based voting system.
Language: Solidity
Dependencies: OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library
Security Features: Time-locked functions to prevent rapid, malicious voting.
Backstory: Created to facilitate fair and transparent governance in a decentralized organization operating in the icy wastes of the crypto world. FrostLock was designed to withstand the harsh conditions of regulatory scrutiny and potential security threats.

Example 2:
PROMPT:
Please generate a random scenario for a new smart contract development project. Attributes to populate:

Project Name: The name of the project where the smart contract will be developed.
Scope: The general functionality and features that the smart contract should have.
Team: The group of developers working on the project.
Challenges: Significant problems or situations that are expected to be encountered during the project.
Solutions: Proposed solutions to overcome the challenges.

Only include the attributes specified in the response, and don't use any special formatting, just output:
[attribute key]: [randomly generated value for attribute]

ANSWER:
Project Name: DesertEye
Scope: A decentralized finance platform with a focus on sustainable investments.
Team: A group of nomadic developers with a deep reverence for nature and blockchain technology.
Challenges: Balancing the need for transparency and security in a decentralized finance platform.
Solutions: Implementing a multi-signature wallet for fund management and using a time-locked contract for major decision-making.

Please write {batch_size} more high quality example PROMPT/ANSWER pairs.

Select a random "scenario" the prompt should represent, which could be a smart contract, a development project, a blockchain platform, or any number of other types of entities or objects.

Be creative in the list of attributes each prompt should ask for, and try to come up with a random list each time.

{topic_avoidance}

All output text should be in {language}, but the exact terms "PROMPT" and "ANSWER" are special tokens that must not be translated.

The output format should be:
PROMPT: [first prompt]
ANSWER: [first prompt's answer]

PROMPT: [second prompt]
ANSWER: [second prompt's answer]
