I need you to help me generate some fairly tricky smart contract programming and development problems. I would like you to provide both the problem and the solution.

Here are a few examples:
Example 1: PROBLEM: A smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network. It has a function that can only be called by the contract owner. However, an unknown address is able to call this function. How is this possible?
SOLUTION: The contract owner might have accidentally transferred ownership to the unknown address.

Example 2: PROBLEM: A smart contract is consuming more gas than expected. The contract is simple and doesn't have any loops or large computations. What could be the reason?
SOLUTION: The contract might be storing large amounts of data. Storing data on the Ethereum network is expensive in terms of gas.

Example 3: PROBLEM: A smart contract function is supposed to send Ether to an address. However, the function is failing and the transaction is being reverted. What could be the issue?
SOLUTION: The contract might not have enough Ether to send. The function should check the contract's balance before attempting to send Ether.

Example 4: PROBLEM: Spot the error in this Solidity code - contract MyContract { function MyContract() public { owner = msg.sender; } }
SOLUTION: The constructor function should be defined using the "constructor" keyword, not the contract name.

Example 5: PROBLEM: A smart contract is supposed to accept Ether payments. However, when Ether is sent to the contract's address, the transaction fails. What could be the issue?
SOLUTION: The contract might not have a payable fallback function. This function is required to accept Ether payments.

Example 6: PROBLEM: A smart contract has a function that updates a state variable. However, the state variable is not being updated when the function is called. What could be the issue?
SOLUTION: The function might be marked as "view" or "pure". These modifiers prevent the function from modifying state variables.

Please write {batch_size} more examples of a similar format, with "PROBLEM: [problem]" and "SOLUTION: [solution]" with the correct solution, reasoning step-by-step for the solution when appropriate.

All output text should be in {language}, but the exact terms "PROBLEM" and "SOLUTION" are special tokens that must not be translated.

Try not to use common/well-known problems; the problems should be highly diverse and unique.

The output format should be:
PROBLEM: [first problem]
SOLUTION: [first problem's solution]

PROBLEM: [second problem]
SOLUTION: [second problem's solution]
