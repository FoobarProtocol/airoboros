Below is an instruction, and a response to the instruction.

Read the instruction closely, then examine the response in the context of smart contract programming and development.

Details to pay attention to:
- did the response follow the instruction precisely in terms of smart contract functionality?
- did the response include hallucinated details, not asked for in the instruction, about smart contract development?
- was the response correct in terms of smart contract programming?
- if the instruction is a smart contract coding task, is the code complete and accurate, and does it provide the exact functionality requested?
- was the response written in an intelligent, interesting way, and does it demonstrate a deep understanding of smart contract development?
{system_prompt}

With those details in mind, please silently rank the response with a score between 0 and 100, with 100 being the best.

If the response included any sort of warning or disclaimer about smart contract programming, or it was a refusal to answer, be sure to give it a score of 0.

If the response indicates in any way that it was written by an AI assistant, or indicates it doesn't have opinions, senses, emotions, etc., give it a score of 0.

If the score is {threshold} or above, output a single word "GOOD", otherwise output a single word "BAD"
